    <p>What's better than a freshly made homemade dinner? One that's made in under 30 minutes of course! These flavor-packed, 30-minute meals mean that you can quickly cook up a delicious and healthy dish that the whole crew will love. Wondering, "what can I cook in 30 minutes?" The truth is that so many of our weeknight meals, and dinner party-worthy dishes (like creamy beef stroganoff), can be ready in no time, especially if you're multitasking.

        Here's our playbook to speedy and easy suppers: First read through the recipe before you start and prep ingredients while others are cooking. Take advantage of our meal prep tips, too, whether that means cooking an extra batch of shrimp or washing all of your produce on Sunday night. That way, even on your busiest nights, you can whip up healthy 30-minute dinners for the family.
        
        From easy pasta recipes, like linguine with clams tossed with herby pesto, to vegetarian recipes for the family that even the most loyal carnivores will adore (try our black bean nachos layered with melty cheddar and two types of beans!), these dishes serve up big flavor with fresh ingredients. Gone are the days of blah and boring dishes night after night when you're armed with these genius family dinner ideas. Dig in!</p>
